It's difficult to pin down where, precisely, it fails, because there are 52 selects in the query (I'M SURE THAT'S OPTIMAL)
and the ones I've tried seem fine.

Possible options remaining:

1) Take the general log, extract all the queries and run them - both separately and sequentially.
  See what (if anything) fails.

2) Just re-write the Gatsby plugin to make smaller requests and queue up any changes

3) Wait for someone *else* to do that and work on the front end!
